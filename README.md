# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

<em>A little about me:</em>

1. I am undertaking a degree in [**Finance**](https://media.tenor.com/tWLm4R_W3-MAAAAM/financial-advisor-jet760.gif) & [**Statistics**](https://media.tenor.com/80EXmSbQc2MAAAAM/andre-braugher-statistics-is-so-beautiful.gif).
2. I am taking **STATS 220** because I need more 2nd year science papers.
3. I am interested in learning about **blue penguins**.
